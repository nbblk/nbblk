https://nextjs-myblog.vercel.app/about is my old website, and you can check out my brief career & education history here.
<br/> I know...ðŸ˜‚ just looking for the right timing to recreate the website.<br/>
I also have a goal this year to write more consistently about what I read/how I've been learning something bi-daily, if possible, or maybe once a week. If you're interested, take a look at https://medium.com/@nbblks.
